# 🧴 Faucet DApp + Direct ETH Sender

This project is a simple Ethereum **Faucet** DApp and a **Direct ETH Transfer** interface built with **React** and **ethers.js**.

It lets you:
- ✅ Connect your MetaMask wallet to a local Hardhat test network.
- ✅ Withdraw test ETH from your faucet smart contract (`withdraw` or `withdrawAll`).
- ✅ Send ETH directly to any Ethereum address by choosing the amount.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 🏗️ Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- Local Hardhat test network running on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

---

## 📂 Available Scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!

## ⚙️ How it works

1️⃣ **Faucet contract interaction**  
- Connect your wallet (MetaMask must be set to your Hardhat local network).
- Click **Withdraw 0.01 ETH** → contract sends ETH to your wallet.
- Click **Withdraw All (Owner)** → withdraws all faucet funds to the owner account.

2️⃣ **Direct ETH transfer**  
- Enter any Ethereum address.
- Enter the amount of ETH you want to send.
- Click **Send ETH** → your wallet directly signs and broadcasts a normal ETH transaction.
- ✅ The transaction will show up as a **“Send”** in MetaMask, not just as a contract interaction.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your MetaMask is connected to your **Hardhat local network** (`http://127.0.0.1:8545`).
- Use the accounts generated by Hardhat (`npx hardhat node`) — these have 10,000 ETH by default.
- Import a Hardhat account into MetaMask using its private key.
